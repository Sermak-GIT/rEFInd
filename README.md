# Matrix theme for rEFInd

This is a fork of the [classroom rEFInd theme](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/838uh5/refind_classroom/) I stumbled upon here. [rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) is a boot manager.

 (note the very suble matrix in the background)

Why?

1. Before the classroom post I used an uninspired theme with plain white icons on a dark background. But I wanted change.

2. I am using Arch and Windows as a dual boot on both my notebook and my desktop, so this duality aspect worked quite well.

## This was created mainly for myself, so it lacks in many ways.

* There are no logos apart from windows and arch linux.
* The design itself does not support more than two systems.
* I only have 1080p Monitors (although donations are welcome :) ), so the theme is not made for or tested on other resolutions.

Thanks to Roderick W. Smith (rodsmith@rodsbooks.com) for keeping rEFIt alive and making it more usable than ever with rEFInd
